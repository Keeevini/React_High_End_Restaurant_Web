## Project Description

A website for a high end restaurant.

Outline of the README:
- [Technologies Used](#LanguagesTech-Stack)
- [Conceptual designs and thoughts](#Design)
- [Installation/Usage](#InstallationUsage)
- [Screenshots](#Screenshots)

### Basic Website Features
- Navigation bar at the top
- Introductory header section

### Languages/Tech Stack
- React

### Tools

**Client side**
- React app
- React-router-dom
- React icons

## Design
The website needs to showcase this restaurant while also be fully compatible with mobile users.

#### Navigation Bar

The bar features a title on the left, section sublinks in the middle, and a login/book on the right. If the width decreases, the section sublinks turn into a hamburger menu that includes a nice translucent overlay.

### Concept
This will be a high end, fine dining, sushi restaurant.

## Installation/Usage

### React Server
Open a terminal the client folder, and run `npm install`

You will need to create a `.env` file in the client folder with the following properties:
```txt
PORT=3001
```

If you choose to run your backend server on a different port than 3000, simply change the baseURL in all the files in the apis folder.

### Usage
That should be all the setup required. `http://localhost:3001/` should be the URL of the home page. The following section of screenshots should be a guide if there are any questions on how to use the web application.

## Testing
